# PokemonProject
This is a web app developed by me as a hobby inspired in Pokémon games.  

This project was made using a container in goormIDE where I registered the domain as https://pkmngo2.run-us-west2.goorm.io/. Multiple .sql codes were developed, where the first creates a table that simulates a pokedex with the pokemon and their types and the final one retruns a table with all the damage points taken by every pokemon for every type, the web app developed using node.js, css and html was created so a user can register a new Pokémon and it will automatically be inserted in the database and return the list with the damage points taken by this Pokémon.
